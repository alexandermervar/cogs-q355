    "Consider a Kohonen self organizing feature map (SOFM), as described in Kohonen (1982). Consider a map with 2500 elements arranged in a 50x50 rectangular grid (matrix). Each input vector has 3 elements in the continuous range of [0,1] that correspond to a signal of one of the primary colors (red, green, blue). For example, (1, 0, 0) is an input pattern that corresponds to the color red."
