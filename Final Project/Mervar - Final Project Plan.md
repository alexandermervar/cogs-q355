**Simulating Pursuit-Evasion Games with Microbial GA and Braitenberg Vehicles**
Inspired by professor Izquierdo's talk last week, I've decided to propose a final project that combines neural networks as well as [Braitenberg vehicles](http://www.harmendeweerd.nl/braitenberg-vehicles/). In the past, Braitenberg vehicles have fascinated me and I intend to improve my understanding of them using a [microbial GA](http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~inmanh/MicrobialGA_ECAL2009.pdf) system too successfully create a [pursuit-evasion game](http://satirist.org/learn-game/systems/pursue.html) between two Braitenberg vehicles. Using these academic techniques, I hope to share Braitenberg vehicles and pursuit-evasion games with my peers in the classroom while growing my knowledge of neural networks by implementing a microbial genetic algorithm.
To create the problem, I will have two agents initialized and I will measure their performance by measuring the winner and loser's win/loss ratio. Additionally, I will be tracking the total time it takes for the pursuing agent to catch the evading agent. If the evasive agent survives a total of 500 time steps, it will be concluded that the evading agent has won and then the pursuing agent will be evolved. If the evading agent is caught within 500 time steps, the evasive agent will evolve. This evolution will follow [Inman Harvey's work in their 1996 paper on the microbial genetic algorithm](http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~inmanh/MicrobialGA_ECAL2009.pdf). At the conclusion of n simulations of 500 time steps, an assortment of different graphics will be made analyzing the agents' performance.
